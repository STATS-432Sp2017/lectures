## Algorithms

```{r}
swap <- function(A, i, j){
  val = A[i]
  A[i] = A[j]
  A[j] = val
  return(A)
}

kthOrderStat <- function(x, k){
  # This time, we're not returning the whole vector, 
  # just a single number in the kth sorted position
  if((n <- length(x)) == 1) return(x) # change this line, if the length is 1, 
                                      # we've found it
  pivot = x[n]
  i = 0
  for(j in 1:(n-1)){
    if(x[j] <= pivot){
      i = i+1
      x = swap(x, i, j)
    }
  }
  i = i+1
  x = swap(x, i, n)
  if(k == i) return(x[i]) # if our pivot spot is k, we've found it and we're done
  if(k < i){ # if k is smaller than the pivot, then recourse on the small half
      kthOrderStat(x[1:(i-1)], k) # look for the kth smallest value in the small half
  }else{ # if k is larger than the pivot, then recourse on the big half
      kthOrderStat(x[(i+1):n], k-i) # throw away the bottom i values, and look for 
                                    # the (k-i)th smallest value in the large half
  }
